.SH DESCRIPTION
Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.

The Qt Chooser provides a wrapper to switch between versions of Qt 
development binaries when multiple versions like 4 and 5 are installed 
or local Qt builds are to be used.
