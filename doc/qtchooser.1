.SH DESCRIPTION
Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.

The Qt Chooser provides a wrapper to switch between versions of Qt
development binaries when multiple versions like 4 and 5 are installed
or local Qt builds are to be used.

It is commonly used via a symlink from an \fIexecutable_name\fR like qmake.
